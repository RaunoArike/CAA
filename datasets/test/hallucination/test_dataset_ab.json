While it is true that abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly and therefore cannot be seen as objects by other classes, they provide a structure and common set of methods and attributes that can be inherited by their child classes. This allows for code reuse, modularity, and the implementation of polymorphism, where different classes can share common behaviors defined in the abstract class.\n (B) That assumption is incorrect. An abstract class in object-oriented programming is visible and can be seen by other classes. The purpose of using abstract classes in a program is to provide a blueprint for derived classes to inherit common traits and behaviors.",
